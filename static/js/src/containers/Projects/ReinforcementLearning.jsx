          of cumulative <em>reward.</em> Reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms. Randomly
          selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The

          scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration
          methods are the most practical.</p>
