        <p>The <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing test,</Link>
          developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to <Link

            behavior</Link> equivalent to, or
          indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator
          would <Link

            natural language conversations</Link> between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like
          responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a
          machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a
          text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and <Link

          depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the
          machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.</p>
