          model is a model for generating all values for a phenomenon, both those that can be observed in the world
          and "target" variables that can only be computed from those observed. By contrast, discriminative models
          provide a model only for the target variable(s), generating them by analyzing the observed variables. In

            models</Link> infer outputs based on inputs, while generative models generate both inputs and outputs,
