# Imaginary A.I.

A portfolio-ish platform that helps visualize some of my interesting Artificial Intelligence projects and researches.

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: **Artificial Intelligence.**

After taking deep learning courses at MIT, Stanford Udacity and Coursera. I started working on projects to reinforce some fundamentals and also have fun with the new area of ML research.

Resources: You'll find interesting datasets on [deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/datasets/) and [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Also find some useful blog posts on [pinchofintelligence.com](https://www.pinchofintelligence.com/), [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/), [Andrew Trask](https://iamtrask.github.io/) and [Chris Olah's](http://colah.github.io/) blog posts. To learn more about Neural Networks and it's various forms, your best bet is the [neural network zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/)
