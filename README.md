# Imaginary A.I.

> by _[Victor I. Afolabi](https://github.com/victor-iyiola/)_

A portfolio-ish platform that helps visualize some of my interesting Artificial Intelligence projects and researches.

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: **Artificial Intelligence.**

After taking deep learning courses at MIT, Stanford Udacity and Coursera. I started working on projects to reinforce some fundamentals and also have fun with the new area of ML research.

Resources: You'll find interesting datasets on [deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/datasets/) and [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Also find some useful blog posts on [pinchofintelligence.com](https://www.pinchofintelligence.com/), [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/), [Andrew Trask](https://iamtrask.github.io/) and [Chris Olah's](http://colah.github.io/) blog posts. To learn more about Neural Networks and it's various forms, your best bet is the [neural network zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/)

## Projects

- Image Classification
- Generative Models
- Image Search
- A.I. Articles
- Auto-encoding
- Reinforcement Learning

## Research

- A language model

## Dependencies

- [Python ^3.6.4](http://python.org/)
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) – ```pip install flask```
- [Keras](http://keras.io/) – ```pip install keras```
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) – ```pip install numpy```
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – ```pip install pandas```
- [Cython](http://cython.org/) – ```pip install cython```

```
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then you probably want to work from your local PC:

Start by cloning the project from github:
```
$ cd ~/Documents/
$ git clone https://github.com/victor-iyiola/imaginary-ai.git
$ cd imaginary-ai
``` 

Then install these requirements:
```
$ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
     
Finally, start the project:
```
$ python __init__.py
```
